# Disclaimer: 

Gemini was used to ensure that the beaverton_library_update_book() procedure's syntax was correct, as well as to create 
the part of the procedure that converts a delimited input string into a table. It was also consulted to help implement 
the multi-select functionality for the Genres field of the Update Book form.

The frontend components, pages, and the backend server.js code relied on the CS340 starter code for CUD operations
and Web Application Technology as a guide and/or foundation, although the exact degree to which code was borrowed 
varies with each file.

Foundational files such as reactServer.cjs, App.jsx, Navigation.jsx, db-connector.js, etc. were necessarily borrowed
directly from the CS340 starter code with minimal tweaks.

All other code in this project is our own work.
